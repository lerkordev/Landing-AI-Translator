    title: 'Fast and accurate AI subtitles in one click',
    paragraph1:
      "Our AI-powered subtitle tools instantly transcribe your videos. Your transcript is then added to your video as word-by-word subtitles, which can be edited directly or downloaded to popular file formats. Why do we care so much about fast subtitles and video captions? Because we know you're moving fast—you have content to create and publish. Accessibility is a priority for you and across all social media platforms, but you can't spend idle time manually editing subtitles.",
    paragraph2:
      "Kapwing's AI subtitles will dramatically speed up the time you spend creating subtitles. In seconds, we’ll begin transcribing your video into a ready-to-use transcript you can edit directly to make perfect. Save hours of time each week and ensure all of your videos are accessible and social-ready. Our tool is so fast, you may never have to send or publish a video without subtitles again. Apply AI subtitles to training videos, social media, content on your YouTube channel, or even personalized one-to-one messages.",

    paragraph1:
      "Kapwing's AI subtitles allow for a near-limitless amount of one-click customization options so your video captions never look bland. Edit colors, sizes, choose between hundreds of fonts (or upload your own), adjust the background and opacity, and even apply animated effects like word-by-word paint and highlights as your subtitles are read.",
    paragraph2:
      "Adjust the smallest details like line height and padding of your subtitle backgrounds. And of course, you can directly edit the text of your AI-generated subtitles to make small corrections or better match the flow of your video. Or, add your Brand Kit so your preferred color palette and fonts are ready to go, whether you’re a professional content creator or in-house creative team. Need to add text to a video that's not a caption? Kapwing can handle that, too.",
